## Bird-cage
This is a simple app that I used to get a feel for [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx)
although this is a simple application, it still gives me an idea of how the Mobx
observable, action and computed decorators work. This is good for now but I will
have to build something more substantial to see how it really works at scale.

I must say, create-react-app (which I aliased to crap) is really nice to use.
It's a fast and easy way to setup a project with minimal configuration. I just use the
`yarn run eject` to modify the files so I can configure the application.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
