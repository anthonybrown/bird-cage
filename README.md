## Bird-cage
This is a simple app that I used to get a feel for [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx)    
although this is a simple application, it still gives me an idea of how the Mobx    
observable, action and computed decorators work. This is good for now but I will    
have to build something more substantial to see how it really works at scale.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
